Dears,
Kindly be informed that you will be given the exact exam time (60 minutes) + 15 minutes to scan a very clear copy of you answer and upload it as a single PDF file. It is preferable to answer in the same file of questions, however feel free to answer in a separate sheet if you've no printer.

You can join us on the online meeting in case of having any inquiries during the exam.

Good luck.
